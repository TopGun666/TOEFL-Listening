3:LEDs use only a quarter the energy of incandescent bulbs.

4:But despite their efficiency, there is one thing they're not that good at: "They have a hard time giving directional light."

5:Sangam Chatterjee, a physicist at the University of Marburg and the University of Giessen, in Germany.

6:Chatterjee and his colleagues may have fixed that.

7:They devised a highly focused, but still energy-efficient light beam, by starting with something that's already a highly focused beam: a laser.

8:The key is what they shoot the laser at: a substance with a particular structure.

9:"I'm always tempted to say "white powdery substance" but I guess there's some connotation on that."


10:They synthesized the material from cages of tin and sulfur atoms decorated with hydrocarbon molecules.

11:The laser-produced infrared light - which the human eye cannot see - goes in, but what comes out are many different optical wavelengths.

12:"It's a molecular light converter.

13:It basically changes the color of the light, while retaining the directionality of the lasers.

14:So you can make something like a white laser beam containing many, many colors."

15:That mix of colors, overall, glows bright white, like a halogen bulb in a beam.

16:The study is in the journal Science.

17:This sort of low-energy focused white beam could be used for the very small - like a light source for microscopes - to the very big.

18:"You could use this for a spotlight in the theater.

19:And in the end it should be much more energy efficient than the typical standard spotlight."

20:Meaning focused white lightâ€¦that takes a little heat off the environment.
