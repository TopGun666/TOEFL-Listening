4:Advocates for self-driving cars love to tout the benefits the cars would bring, such as fewer accidents and less congestion.

5:Another alleged value of being a passenger rather than a driver is more productivity-you could work rather than concentrate on driving.

6:But most people might not spend their newfound free time in self-driving cars whittling down their to-do lists.

7:That's according to a study by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at The University of Michigan's Sustainable Worldwide Transportation program.

8:The researchers surveyed people in the U.S., Australia, China, India, Japan and the U.K.

9:And about 62 percent of respondents said self-driving cars would not make them more productive.

10:For one thing, 23 percent of the group said they won't ride in a self-driving car in the first place.

11:And then there are the people who get motion sickness-they obviously can't work.

12:Plus, another 36 percent said they'd be too concerned to do anything but watch the road.

13:The researchers also noted that most trips average 19 minutes-not really long enough to get anything truly substantial done.

14:Or to catch some quality zzzzz's.

15:
Of course, the level of apprehension people experience in self-driving cars, or about getting into them, may change in the long-run.

16:But this study is another reminder that there's still a lot to be figured out before automatic autos rule the roadways.

17:Thanks for the minute for Scientific American - 60-Second Science.
