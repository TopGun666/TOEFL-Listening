3:Got a minute?

4:"I have now worked in seven states across India, and we've looked at human-wildlife interactions, particularly human-wildlife conflict ranging from crop loss, livestock predation, human death, human injury and property damage."
 
5:Krithi Karanth, a Wildlife Conservation Society researcher also affiliated with India's Centre for Wildlife Studies and Duke University in the U.S.
 
6:"Fortunately most of the losses are crop losses and to a much lower extent livestock predation, property damage, human injury and human death occur... the policies and procedures for compensation varies hugely among states in India, but there is a compensation process in most states.

7:What we also found is that less than 30 percent of affected people are filing.

8:They're very frustrated with the bureaucracyâ€¦so in 2013 I thought of an idea, because I travel for hundreds of villages across India for my research projects.

9:And we realized that everybody had access to cell phones-it was very simple for people to call in and report an incident.

10:
So with my collaborator Nikhil Velpanur, in 2013 we set up a web portal and a technology platform that integrates a toll-free number with the ability to address calls that came in."

11:
"So the idea is very simple.

12:
Anybody experiencing a conflict incident calls in to the toll-free number and our field coordinator assigns our field agents to go and evaluate the problem.

13:Once the evaluation is done we help them file the documentation... and so in 2015 we launched Project Wild Seve in Bandipore and Nagarahole National Parks.

14:We covered over 300 villages by distributing 30,000 pamphlets.

15:What we've been able to achieve I think has far exceeded my expectations and is pretty remarkable.

16:In a year, we've helped over 3,400 cases files and recorded with the government.

17:This has allowed almost 1,000 families who have already achieved compensation and another 2,400 well on their way to receiving compensation."

18:"I feel that Wild Seve is scalable and adaptable to any place or any country in the world where we see human-wildlife conflict.

19:It's a simple system that works off a toll-free number which can be established anywhere... it is not the only solution to addressing human-wildlife conflicts, but it's certainly one tool we have in our toolbox, and certainly from an Indian perspective it's very much part of our policies."

20:Thanks for the minute for Scientific American - 60-Second Science.
