3: On June 3rd, a train loaded with highly volatile crude oil derailed just outside the small town of Mosier in Oregon's Columbia River Valley.

4: More than 40000 gallons of crude spilled out of the train.

5: Some burned away in a 14 hour long fire at the scene.

6: Some got into the wastewater treatment system.

7: And some of the spilled crude oil found its way into the nearby groundwater.

8: Crews with Union Pacific Railroad Company and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality are now focused on getting that groundwater clean again.

9: They're using a technique called "biosparging, " which helps the naturally occurring microorganisms at the site consume the oil.

10: The biosparging relies on pumping additional oxygen underground.

11: "And this additional oxygen will cause the population of microbes to expand very quickly."

12: Oregon Department of Environment of Environmental Quality project manager Bob Schwarz.

13: "So the more microbes, the more quickly the oil gets consumed."

14: Schwarz says it;s unclear exactly how much oil contaminated the groudwater.

15: "We're measuring it in hundreds of parts per billion, with a 'b,' so it's a very small mass."

16: But the levels are still high enough for us to have to clean it up.

17: Schwarz saysthe groundwater treatment system will likely continue for the next year.

18: Meanwhile, trains will resume carrying oil through the area-a move that, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting, local fire chief Jim Appleton called "insane" at time of the accident/
