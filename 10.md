3:Old Yeller was a great smeller.

4:Dogs in general have superior smelling abilities.

5:They detect dead bodies, illegal drugs and explosives-even cancer.

6:But dogs don't just have great olfactory gear.

7:Another reason they're amazing chemical detectors?

8:...is the sniff.

9:"And it turns out almost every breed of dog does this at 5 Hz.

10:Five times a second."

11:Matthew Staymates, a mechanical engineer and fluid dynamicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

12:Sniffing, he says, is really a two-part process.

13:"Inspiration, expiration, right?

14:Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale."

15:That second part, the exhale, is key.

16:"So when the dog is actively sampling or sniffing on the ground, there is a turbulent air jet that exits each nostril during the exhale phase.

17:Just like when you and I exhale there's an air jet that comes out of our nostrils.

18:But the dog is down on the ground and those air jets are vectored down and toward its rear.

19:And in the world of fluid dynamics, if I pulse an air jet in one direction I basically pull air with it."

20:So the dog is creating a pressure differential that effectively pulls new scents toward its nose.

21:Staymates and his colleagues discovered that effect using a 3-D-printed model of a Labrador retriever's nose, which they tested with fluid dynamics equipment.

22:They then outfitted a commercial vapor detector with sniffing nostrils, inspired by the dog nose.

23:And they found that the actively sniffing detector was 16 times better at picking up the scent of explosives, compared to just continuously drawing in air-whick is the usual method.

24:The results are in the journal Scientific Reports.

25:Staymates says he hopes next-generation sensors take sniffing seriously.

26:"There's nanosensors out there that can detect very, very small amounts of materials.

27:One of the things that's been overlooked: is how do you get the molecules of interest to the detector, right?

28:So you can have the most sophisticated detector in the world, but unless you can get material to it, it's not very useful."

29:Adding a sniffer thoughâ€¦could be just the thing to make those detectors more dogged.

30:Thanks for listening for Scientific American - 60-Second Science.
