4:The 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine goes to Yoshinori Ohsumi of Japan for his discoveries of mechanisms of what's known as autophagy.

5:Break the word down and you get auto and phagy: from the Greek for self, auto, and eating, phagein.

6:So, self-eating.

7:Autophagy refers to a process in cells whereby they destroy themselves and send the parts out for recycling.

8:Cells do this by enclosing their contents in tiny sacks, called vesicles.

9:Those vesicles then get transported to an organelle within the cell called the lysosome.

10:Where the sacks get degraded and the contents are made available for reuse.

11:Autophagy had been observed a half-century before Ohsumi's work in the 1990's while at the University of Tokyo.

12:But it was his research that made clear its fundamental importance.

13:He did that work with baker's yeast.

14:One way he made his discoveries was to interfere with the process and thus see vesicles involved in autophagy start to build up-this action proved that yeast cells performed autophagy.

15:He went on to identify 15 genes crucial for the process.

16:Need quick fuel for energy?

17:Autophagy makes that fuel available fast.

18:Need raw materials for maintenance in other cells?

19:Autophagy gets those materials into the system so the body can respond to starvation and other stresses.

20:Infected?

21:Autophagy plays a part in capturing and killing bacteria and viruses.

22:It clears out damaged proteins and organelles, thus helping to fight the effects of aging.

23:At the other end of the life cycle, autophagy is involved in the development of embryos.

24:It's truly a fundamental process.

25:Ohsumi is 71 years old.

26:He's currently an emeritus professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

27:The Nobel Prize comes with a monetary award of about $1.2 million.

28:Thanks for the minute for Scientific American - 60-Second Science.

29:I'm Steve Mirsky.
