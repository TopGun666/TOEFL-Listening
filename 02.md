3:Random numbers are hugely important for modern computing.

4:They're used to encrypt credit card numbers and emails.

5:To inject randomness into online gaming.

6:And to simulate super complex phenomena, like protein folding or nuclear fission.

7:But here's the dirty secret: a lot of these so-called random numbers are not truly random.

8:They're actually what's known as "pseudo random numbers," generated by algorithms.

9:Think of generating random numbers by rolling dice.

10:If you know the number of dice, it's simple to figure out something about the realm of possible random numbers-thus putting probabilistic limits on the randomness.

11:But truly random numbers can be generated through quantum mechanical processes.

12:So researchers built a photonic chip-a computer chip that uses photons instead of electrons.

13:The chip has two lasers: one shoots continuously; the other pulses at regular intervals.

14:Each time the two lasers meet, the interference between the light beams is random, thanks to the rules of quantum mechanics.

15:The chip then digitizes that random signal, and voila: a quantum random number generator.

16:The study is in the journal Optica.

17:It's not the first time this sort of thing's been built.

18:But compared to old prototypes, this chip is much smaller-a sixth the size of a penny-and works at high speeds, too.

19:Meaning small and fast enough for a smartphone?

20:The researchers say that's an entirely predictable outcome.
